# 🧾 Project Report – Online Food Delivery System (Basic SQL Project)

This project is a beginner-level SQL project based on an Online Food Delivery System 🍔📦. The main goal was to understand how databases work and how to use SQL to store, retrieve, and analyze data.

I started by creating a database and setting up tables for Customers, Restaurants, Orders, Menu Items, and Order Details. Then, I practiced writing basic SQL queries to explore the dataset and answer simple business-related questions.

The key tasks included:

🗄 Creating tables and inserting sample data

🔍 Using SELECT and WHERE clauses to filter information

📋 Sorting and limiting results with ORDER BY and LIMIT

🤝 Joining multiple tables using JOIN

🧮 Applying aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, and AVG

Finally, I used the query results to get insights such as most ordered food items, total revenue per city, and active customers.

# 🎯 Outcome:
This project helped me learn the fundamentals of SQL — how to design a simple database, write queries, and analyze real-world data. It was a great starting point for building confidence in data analytics and database management.
