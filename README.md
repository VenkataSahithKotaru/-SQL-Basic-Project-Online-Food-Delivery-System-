# -SQL-Basic-Project-Online-Food-Delivery-System-
SQL basic project on Online Food Delivery dataset covering database design, queries, business insights, and visualizations.

This project focuses on analyzing data from an Online Food Delivery System 🍔📦 using SQL to uncover key business insights. The aim was to design a complete relational database, write queries to explore and manipulate data, and generate insights that can improve restaurant operations and customer satisfaction.

The process began with database design — creating ER diagrams, setting up the schema, and defining tables for customers, restaurants, orders, menu items, and order details. Once the database was structured, multiple SQL queries were executed to answer business questions and discover insights such as:

🏙 Top-performing cities by order volume and revenue

🍽 Best-selling food items and their total sales

👥 Top customers by spending behavior

🏢 Restaurant-wise performance and underperforming outlets

📅 Monthly order trends and seasonal patterns

To make the results more meaningful, the data was exported to Google Sheets, where charts and visualizations were created to present key findings clearly.

Finally, all tasks and outputs were compiled into a 29-page detailed report created in Canva, showcasing the full workflow — from data design to analysis and visualization.

# Outcome:
This project demonstrates how SQL can turn raw data into actionable business insights, strengthening analytical thinking and database management skills — essential for roles in Data Analytics, Data Engineering, and Business Intelligence.
